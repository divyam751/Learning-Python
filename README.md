# Learning-Python

- .py is an extension
- pip is similar like npm
- for comment ctrl + / comment line strat with " # "
- multiline comments """ triple double quotes

# Chapter01_practice set

- we can print multilins by using """ or ''' inside print ()

# Chapter02

- print(not(True)) ===> (Valid) instead of ! operator
- print(type(a))==> for printing the type
- float(a) , int(a), str(a) ==> use for type casting in python
- input() will take input as string , so we need to do type caste here

# Chapter02_practice set

- a^b is not valid in python instead use a\*\*b for doing powers

# Chapter03

- 04_escape_seq
- \"boy\" ==> for printing "" inside another " "

# Chapter03-PS

- print(f"Good Afternoon, {name} ") ==> use f string if you want to use variable inside the string

# Chapter4

```python

# It's similar like destructuring in javascript

my_tuple = (1,2,3)
a,b,c = my_tuple
print(a,b,c)

```
